Mario Land Mod allows you to emulate your favourite characters from the Super Mario franchise, being able to look, sound, and act exactly like them!

With this mod you can play as Mario, Luigi, Wario, Waluigi, and any other characters that will be added in the future, being able to use their entire movesets and many of their Power-Ups.

THIS MOD IS AN ALPHA VERSION. MUCH LIKE TML, MUCH OF THE CONTENT OF THE MOD HASN'T MADE IT IN YET, AND WILL SLOWLY BE PUT INTO THE MOD WITH REGULAR UPDATES.

Speaking of which, I recommend going into the character creation menu, since that is currently the only way to obtain available transformation items and PowerUps :)
